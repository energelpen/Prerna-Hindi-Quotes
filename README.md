# Prerna हिन्दी

**Prerna हिन्दी** is a small web project aimed at generating random Hindi quotes to inspire and motivate users. This project serves as a learning tool for me, allowing me to explore and implement various web development technologies.

## Project Overview

This project features:

- **Tailwind CSS** for styling: Tailwind CSS is used to create a responsive and modern design with utility-first classes. This project helped me learn how to use Tailwind CSS to quickly style elements and make the interface visually appealing.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic content: JavaScript is used to handle user interactions and dynamically update the content displayed on the page.
- **API Integration**: The project integrates with the [Hindi Quotes API](https://hindi-quotes.vercel.app/) provided by [nkilm](https://github.com/nkilm/hindi-quotes) to fetch and display Hindi quotes. This integration allowed me to practice working with APIs, handling asynchronous data, and updating the DOM based on API responses.

## Features

- **Random Quote Display**: The main feature of the application is to display a random Hindi quote on page load and whenever the "Generate Random Quote" button is clicked.
- **Category-Based Quote Display**: Users can select a quote category from a dropdown menu, and the application will fetch and display a quote from the selected category.
- **Static Quotes**: Five static cards at the bottom of the page are initialized with random quotes to provide additional inspiration.

## Learning Experience

This project has been a great way for me to learn and apply:
